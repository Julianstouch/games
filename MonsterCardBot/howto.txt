Features : 
- Farm Haunted Port 2, and was farming Sunken ship 1.
Why HP2 : max damage is 60, only in mid. Card +30 shield with item +30 shield makes it. Add any damager for regen.
Why SS1 : no (or nearly none) direct damage. Any card with 70hp + cautious item would do it. Add a healer. 
- Plays card according orders and restrictions
- Manage sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice cost, card play cost, and card color
- While running, if you open the game from another computer, the bot stop, and restart 30 min later.
It is made to take manual control for daily spin and duels, then it restart botting.
- When restarting, manage surrendering to restart a clean round.

My Current set :
For old SS1 : Kronan, Granger and Squid. Good for leveling, Granger to sacrifice.
Items : Dryadstaff and PlanetSmasher.

For actual HP2 : Headless, Squid and Granger. Squid for sacrifice.
Items : TowerShield, Herald bow, and Toxic blade.

Alternative for HP2 : 2 Red Dragon (at least level 4), Snarer. Just a Protector as item.

How to set up your deck :
In the file ManageFight, method lancerCombat
Define your monster :
- Playable (getMonsterPlay) , Sacrifice (getMonsterSacr), or Both (play tested first)
Then : name, color, cost to play, play position OR sacrifice cristal gain.

Define your item same way, except it's getItemPlay and so.

Define condition : 
- card1.getPlayCondition.add(card2) : the card2 must have been played for Card to be played.
- card1.getSacrCondition.add(card2) : if the card 2 is sacrifice, then card 1 can't be sacrified.

Define checking / playing order :
cardAction1.setNext(cardAction2).setNext(fin)

! Attention ! 
There is a difference between Cards defined, and CardAction for the chain.
CARD : Card heal = Card.getMonsterSacr("Squid", tGreen , 3, 3);
CARD ACTION : IAction debut = new CardAction(heal, this);

And always have :
IAction fin = new EndOfCard(null, this);
And  .setNext(fin);   at the end of the chain.



IF you want to farm another spot, define new coords in MoveMap file.
Actual :
2 zone on map
    private final Dimension SUNKEN = new Dimension(372, 406);
    private final Dimension PORT = new Dimension(402, 301);
1 area in zone (sunken 1 and haunted 2 are at the same position)
    private final Dimension SUNKEN_A1 = new Dimension(272, 96);

If you add yours 
    private final Dimension YOURS = new Dimension(xxx, yyy);
    private final Dimension YOURS_A? = new Dimension(xxx, yyy);
And in code, change :
mMove(PORT);        to  mMove(YOURS);
mMove(SUNKEN_A1);   to  mMove(YOURS_A?);
